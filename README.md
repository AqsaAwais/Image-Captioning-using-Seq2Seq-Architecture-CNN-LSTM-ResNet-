# Image-Captioning-using-Seq2Seq-Architecture-CNN-LSTM-ResNet-
This project generates captions for images using a pretrained ResNet for feature extraction and a sequence-to-sequence model for caption generation. Implemented in PyTorch with support for early stopping, learning rate scheduling, and saving best model checkpoints.
